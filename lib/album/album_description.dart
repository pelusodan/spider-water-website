# Markdown demo
      
## Overview

The Dart package parses Markdown
into HTML. The flutter_markdown package builds on this package using the
abstract syntax tree generated by the parser to make a tree of widgets instead
of HTML elements.

The markdown package supports the basic block and inline Markdown syntax
specified in the original Markdown implementation as well as a few Markdown
extensions. The markdown package uses extension sets to make extension
management easy. There are four pre-defined extension sets; none, Common Mark,
GitHub Flavored, and GitHub Web. The default extension set used by the
flutter_markdown package is GitHub Flavored.

The Basic Markdown Demo shows the effect each of the pre-defined extension sets
has on a test Markdown document with basic and extended Markdown tags. Use the
Extension Set dropdown menu to select an extension set and view the Markdown
widget's output.
